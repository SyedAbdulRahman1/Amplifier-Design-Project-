# Amplifier-Design-Project-
This GitHub repository documents my ELE404 Amplifier Design Project, conducted in Electronic Circuits I course at Toronto Metropolitan University. The project focuses on designing, simulating, and testing a multistage, transistor amplifier using BJTs. This project includes all design calculations, simulation files, and experimental results.

ELE404 Amplifier Design Project
Project Overview
The ELE404 Amplifier Design Project aims to design a single-supply, multistage, inverting transistor amplifier that meets specific performance criteria. The project uses Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs) to achieve the desired specifications, providing a hands-on approach to understanding and applying electronic circuit design principles.

Objectives
Power Supply: +10V relative to the ground
Quiescent Current: No larger than 10 mA
Voltage Gain: |Av| = 50 (±10%) at 1 kHz
Output Voltage Swing: Minimum 8 Vpp no-load, 4 Vpp with a 1 kΩ load
Input Resistance: At least 20 kΩ at 1 kHz
Frequency Response: 20 Hz to 50 kHz (−3dB response)
Circuit Design
The amplifier circuit consists of three stages, each fulfilling a unique role within the system:

Common Collector (CC) Stage: Acts as a buffer to ensure high input impedance and minimize signal loss.
Common Emitter (CE) Stage: Provides the necessary voltage amplification.
Final CC Stage: Serves as an output stage to maintain voltage gain and minimize the load effect.
Simulation
Tool Used: NI Multisim
Purpose: To verify the theoretical designs and ensure that the amplifier meets all specified performance parameters.
Results: The simulation confirmed that the design meets the required specifications for gain, impedance, and frequency response.
Experimental Setup
Components: 2N3904 transistors, electrolytic capacitors, resistors from the E24 series.
Measurements: Gain, output swing, and frequency response were tested under both loaded and no-load conditions.
Conclusions
The project successfully demonstrated the use of BJTs in creating an effective amplifier capable of meeting specified design criteria. It highlighted the practical application of theoretical knowledge and the critical importance of careful component selection and circuit configuration.
